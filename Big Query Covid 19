--Part A. A column that represents, for each row, the Z-Score of "confirmed_cases" of that row as normalized against the entirety of the dataset
--Part B. A column to be called "confirmed_cases_zscore_state" that represents for each row, the Z-Score of confirmed cases but as normalized based on the state_name to which that row belongs. 
--Part C. A column to be called "highest_monthly_confirmed_cases" that represents, for each rowthe largest "confirmed_cases" for the state to which that row belongs 
--Part D. A column that computes "confirmed_cases_per_death"
